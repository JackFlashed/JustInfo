# Useful Links and whatnot

### Stuff that makes the gears spin:

- [x] [Hekate](https://github.com/CTCaer/hekate/releases): (Included: hekate v5.5.8 & Nyx v1.0.4) Quick info - bootloader and an all around multitool. 

- [x] [Atmosphere](https://github.com/Atmosphere-NX/Atmosphere/releases): (Included version: AtmosphÃ¨re 0.19.5 + fusee-primary.bin)
(I included both fusee-primary, as well as secondary. Was this necessary? No. Again.. I like options. The file size addition is tiny.) Quick info - what makes your firmware custom. 

##### Sigpatches 
(Kind of what makes some of the gears turn in the background. For example, if you ask the switch to run code, it may ask 'should I?' sigpatches can make it not ask such questions. A very basic example, but hopefully informative. Much effort has been made to make these not a concern.)

**Computer application *NOT* included. Link provided to grab the needed files / information.**

- [x] [Unoffical ldn_mitm](https://canary.discord.com/channels/487183423744507905/487183424172589057/850475131516092436) (complied for ams 19.2+) - Included

(Thanks to Switch Lan Play discord. At the time of this release, the offical version wasn't functional. Simply follow the above guide with the one that's already included.) 

### Notes / Additions:
- [x] Hosts file already in place for additional protections

- [x] exosphere.ini (blanks your serial number) included

- [x] Added 3 shops as default to tinfoil (No set up needed. Shops often come and go, but at the time of release, this is functional without any other work. If you get failed to load messages on any of them, you can remove them.)

- [x] Block tinfoil.io / 162.252.82.229 telemetry * note - this will allow you to connect to shops still / otherwise use tinfoil, however it will prevent updates and may prevent loading of icons or images. However, it should still remain functional otherwise. IF you wish to remove this block, edit the hosts file: SD:\atmosphere\hosts\emummc.txt and remove the lines: 127.0.0.1 *tinfoil.io and 127.0.0.1 *162.252.82.229

- [x] Added fastcfw config - allows you to swap boot options easy or return to hekate... fast! 

- [x] Added advailable emuiibo's - to allow you to emulate them in game simply. Ready to go. 

- [x] 4 homebrew menu themes added - You can check them out by going to the theme menu while in the homebrew menu.

- [x] One set of themes to try with NX Theme Installer. 

- [x] Homebrew with no icon = icon was added. I found no icon was visually unappealing. Quick edit to add icons to iconless homebrew. 

- [x] Hekate custom background and icons. Should help explain what boot options do more clearly. 

- [x] Custom boot splash screens = gold(secondary),green(primary),red(system). Gives you a quick visual indication of what you are booting into.
